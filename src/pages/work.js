      <p className="section-content">GraphQL in Motion is an in-depth course that covers the fundementals of building a GraphQL API and connecting it to a <a href="https://graphqlnews.co" target="_blank">modern client-side application</a>. Viewers begin by learning how GraphQL fits into various application architectures, including how it compares to REST and other API styles. Following a series of examples, they learn to use the GraphQL syntax to write simple data-retrieval queries, dig into schema design, and tackle more advanced challenges like direct data manipulation and error handling. Along the way, the course is peppered with quizzes that check viewer's understanding of the material and exercises that encourage them to practice as they go so they'll be ready to take on the real world.</p>

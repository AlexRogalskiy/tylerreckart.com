In the years since I became interested in mechanical watches and watchmaking, I have also come to be fascinated by one of the core systems that humanity uses to delineate the passage of time: calendars. There are few complications in the world of horology that elicit goosebumps among collectors and enthusiasts alike than a masterfully constructed perpetual calendar. Aside from the minute repeater, the perpetual calendar is one of the most technically difficult measures of a watchmaker's skill.

The magic in the perpetual calendar's mechanism lies in what if prevents the wearer from having to do. Wristwatches bearing a complication that could give you the current date have been around since 1945, with the first example appearing on the Rolex Datejust. However, a simple date-bearing watch has to be manually adjusted five times a year. The complication is simple in its constructions and does not account for the varying lengths of months in the Gregorian calendar. This means that at the end of every month with less than thirty-one days, the owner must advance the date manually to keep it correct.

This is where the perpetual calendar is different. Like the standard date, a timepiece with the complication will give you the current day of the month, however unlike it, the perpetual calendar *does* account for the varying lengths of the months in our calendar. The morning after a month ending in thirty days, a perpetual calendar will read the first day of the next month. In addition to being able to account for 30 and 31 day months, the perpetual calendar also knows how to deal with the end of the month of February. If set correctly, on the fourth year of a leap year cycle, the perpetual calendar will advance the date to the 29th of February without any needed input from the wearer.

In reality, if kept wound, a perpetual calendar will at the very least be able to tell the wearer the current date, day of the week, month, year, and current year in the leap year cycle without adjustment until the year 2100. While you and I will be long gone before that adjustment period comes, it was this universal barrier to the complication's accuracy that caught my attention.

In order to understand the limitations of the perpetual calendar's mechanism, we have to go back to the [Roman calendar](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/calendar/romancalendar.html). Attributed to [Romulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus) himself, the early Roman calendar was based on the lunar cycle and seasons of the agricultural year. The year began in March at the start of spring and ended in December with autumn planting, consisting of ten months for a total of 304 days. 

According to [Livy](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Livy) in _The Early History of Rome_, Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, adjusted his predecessor's calendrical system by dividing the year into twelve lunar months. He did this first by adding an additional fifty days to the year and secondly by taking a day from each month of thirty days to allow for two winter months, January and February, both of which had twenty-eight days. However, the Roman's were a superstitious people. Because of their aversion to even numbers, an additional day was added to January to comprise a year of 355 days. February, however, was left untouched. The month itself was considered unlucky, and was therefore devoted to rites of purification.

By 673 BC the Romans had developed a calendar that is would be recognizable to a modern-day human, but it was not without issue. The moon's lunation, which their calendar was based on, has a period of approximately 29.5 days. This is not the same as the length of Earth's annual orbit around the sun, a period of approximately 365.25 days. Twelve lunar months are shorter than a solar year by about 11 days. While this discrepancy may seem minor, without [intercalating](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/calendar/intercalation.html) (inserting) those 11 missing days, the Roman calendar would fall out of synchronicity with the seasons. It is this fact that brings us to the year 46 BC and to the man responsible for the longest year in human history, Julius Caesar.

At the time Caesar was Rome's _[pontifex maximus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontifex_maximus)_, the highest elected religious official in the Roman Republic. As the pontifex maximus, one of his duties was to regulate the intercalation of days into the Roman calendar. However, beginning in 58 BC Caesar was occupied with his conquest of Gaul and his subsequent [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar%27s_Civil_War) with Pompey. There hadn't been an intercalation since Caesar's election to the proconsulship in 58 BC. By his return to Rome from Egypt in 46 BC and his election to the dictatorship there was a three month discrepancy between the seasons and the calendar date. The harvest was being celebrated before the crops had even been taken in.

Due to the discrepancy, and with the knowledge of the Egyptian solar calendar that he gleaned during his time in the region, Caesar at the direction of the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes added ninety extra days to the year 46 BC, bringing its length to 455 days. The calendar that resulted from his reform consisted of four nearly equal seasons divided into 365 days. Because the solar year is approximately a quarter of a day longer than the Julian's calendar year, a single intercalary day was inserted every four years, introducing the concept of the leap year.

The cycle of the Julian calendar averaged 365.25 days, but this still does not exactly correspond to the the solar year. Instead of being 11 days to short, as the original Roman 12-month calendar was, it was approximately 11 _minutes_ too long, gaining almost a day every 128 years. As with the early calendar, this discrepancy was minor, but by the mid-sixteenth century, it amounted to approximately ten days. The vernal (spring) equinox, which the church used to calculate the date of Easter, was no longer occurring on March 21. To correct for this regression, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII omitted the extra ten days. In that year, October 4 was to be followed by October 15, and to prevent the issue from arising in the following centuries, three leap years were to be omitted every four-hundred years. The Gregorian calendar has been in use ever since.

It is this last fact that brings us to the issue present in modern perpetual calendar mechanisms. The mechanics involved to account for the four-century leap year cycle would be impossible to miniaturize to a form that would fit on the wrist or in a pocket. That being said, even with its imperfect mechanism, the perpetual calendar serves as a window into the cultural history of our species and an inspiration for generations to come.
